Chapter 15 - Running Camel via WildFly-Camel
--------------------------

This example shows how to run Camel using the WildFly-Camel subsystem.

You can package this example as a skinny WAR (WildFly-Camel manages the dependencies) using:

    mvn install -Pdeploy

This will also deploy the WAR to a WildFly instance running locally.
