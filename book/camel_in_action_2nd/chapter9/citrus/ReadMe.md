Example of testing a Camel application with the Citrus Integration Testing Framework - http://www.citrusframework.org/.

### 9.6.3 Using Citrus Framework to test Camel applications

You can build the example first

    mvn compile

Then you can run the integration test that runs Citrus

    mvn integration-test

Yes you have to use `integration-test` as `test` is for running unit tests only.
