Chapter 8 - order-router-full
----------------

### 8.1.1 - Using Camel Maven archetypes

This order-router directory contains a skeleton project generated by a Maven archetype. This directory contains a project filled out with a test FTP server running on localhost, a CXF configuration, a JMS connection factory, and so on. 

You can run a test like:

	mvn test -Dtest=OrderRouterTest

### 8.2.2 - Debugging an issue with your new Camel project

You can run the debugger test like:

	mvn test -Dtest=OrderRouterDebuggerTest

To get the full effect though, you'd need to set a breakpoint on the debugBefore or debugAfter methods in your IDE. debugBefore will be invoked before each processor and debugAfter will be invoked after.
